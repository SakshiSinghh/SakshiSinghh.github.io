									<p>My temate and I developed a virtual reality game in which players embarked on a quest to retrieve a vital orb and prevent reality from being annihilated by the nefarious super-villain, Malvus. Players were armed with a variety of weapons, a protective shield, and an arsenal of unique attacks, all essential for their journey. To emerge victorious in the game, players had to conquer a horde of formidable minions and ultimately confront the highly intelligent villain, Malvus, in an epic battle of wits and skill.As a testament to the project's success, I achieved an "A".</p>

									<p>I leveraged my expertise in server-side programming, SQL database management, and scripting languages to develop a dynamic website backend that delivers robust functionality and ensures seamless user experiences. The implemented features encompass persistent login/logout, advanced DVD search capabilities by title or category (with optional budget constraints), detailed DVD information display, admin-exclusive features like actor and customer addition, and stringent JWT-based access rights for web APIs.

									<a href="https://github.com/SakshiSinghh/Managing-Ubuntu-Server-and-Wordpress-" class="image fit"><img src="images/ubuntu.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I set up a virtual machine and installed Apache, PHP, and MySQL. User groups and permissions were managed for security. Then, I installed, configured, and monitored a WordPress website with the root document at '/var/www/html/'. Apache's document root was aligned accordingly, and I established proper permissions for 'www-data' and 'webdev.' I also created a MySQL user, 'wordpress-user-', with the necessary database rights for the WordPress site, named 'wordpress-db-'. This ensured a secure and well-functioning WordPress environment.</p>
